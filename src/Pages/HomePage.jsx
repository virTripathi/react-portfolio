      Hi folks, Virat here, I’m a Full Stack Developer who loves crafting intuitive web applications.
      I work primarily with PHP and JavaScript, but I’m always eager to explore
      new technologies. Besides coding, you can find me travelling, playing badminton,
      or hitting the weights. I believe in the power of
      collaboration and can’t wait to create something amazing together!
